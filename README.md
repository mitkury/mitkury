Main projects:
- [Sila](https://github.com/silaorg/sila) - an open alternative to ChatGPT
- [AIWrapper](https://github.com/mitkury/aiwrapper) - AI wrapper for JS/TS
- [AIModels](https://github.com/mitkury/aimodels) - a collection of AI model specifications
- [RepTree](https://github.com/mitkury/reptree) - a tree data structure using CRDTs for seamless replication between peers
- [TTabs](https://github.com/mitkury/ttabs) - tiling tabs like in VSCode with Svelte
- [Airul](https://github.com/mitkury/airul) - managing context for AI agents

I use AIWrapper in Sila and other AI projects. AIModels provides info about AI models in AIWrapper and Sila. RepTree plays a role of a DB in Sila. TTabs powers the layout of Sila. Airul helps me to manage context for AI agents I use at the moment (Cursor, Codex).
