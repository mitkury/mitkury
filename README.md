Main projects:
- [Supa](supa) - an open alternative to ChatGPT
- [AIWrapper](aiwrapper) - AI wrapper for JS/TS
- [AIModels](aimodels) - a collection of AI model specifications
- [RepTree](reptree) - a tree data structure using CRDTs for seamless replication between peers
- [TTabs](ttabs) - tiling tabs like in VSCode with Svelte

I use AIWrapper in Supa and other AI projects. AIModels provides info about AI models in AIWrapper and Supa. RepTree plays a role of a DB in Supa. TTabs powers the layout of Supa.
